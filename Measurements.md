# Measurements

A measurement can be viewed as observing the composite system of the measurement apparatus and the quantum system to be measured. The observation collapses the composite system into an eigenstate that can be observed macroscopically. This view is consistent with the composite system postulate (observable, measurement probability and collapse).

Mathematically, a measurement operator is in the form of $\ket{p_0}\bra{p_0}$, where $p_0$ is an eigenstate of the observable. For example, $\ket{p_0}\braket{p_0|\psi}$ projects $\ket\psi$ onto $\ket{p_0}$. $\braket{p_0|\psi}$ is the amplitude and the probability of measuring $p_0$ is $|\braket{p_0|\psi}|^2$​​.

Experimentally, the measurement operator is "casted" on the wave function to "extract" the real eigenvalue.
