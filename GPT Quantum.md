## Energy eigenbasis discreteness

Prompt: While the dimension of eigenbasis of continuous quantities like position and momentum is infinite, can energy eigenbasis be in infinite dimension and therefore has a continuous spectrum of energy in the same system?

In quantum mechanics, whether the energy eigenbasis of a system is finite or infinite in dimension, and whether the energy spectrum is discrete, continuous, or a combination of both, depends heavily on the physical setup and the nature of the Hamiltonian describing the system.

### Infinite-Dimensional Energy Eigenbasis and Continuous Energy Spectrum

1. **Infinite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces**:
   - Many quantum systems are modeled in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This is typical for systems where the particles are not confined to a finite region or are only partially confined, allowing for a wide, potentially infinite, range of states.
   
2. **Continuous Spectrum**:
   - A continuous energy spectrum occurs in situations where the energy levels can take any value within certain ranges. This is often the case in systems without bound states, such as a free particle in open space. In these scenarios, the Hamiltonianâ€™s spectrum does not consist of isolated points (discrete eigenvalues), but rather a continuum.
   - Example: A particle in a box (with infinitely high walls) will exhibit a discrete spectrum as the boundary conditions confine the particle, leading to quantization of energy. Conversely, a free particle in unbounded space will have a continuous spectrum since it can have any energy level.

3. **Mixed Spectra**:
   - Some systems may exhibit both discrete and continuous spectra simultaneously. This happens, for example, in the quantum description of atoms with an electron in an external field. Near the nucleus, the electron states are quantized (discrete spectrum), while at higher energy levels, where the electron might escape the atomic potential, the spectrum becomes continuous.

### Continuous Energy Spectrum and Quantum Systems

The concept of a continuous energy spectrum is crucial when dealing with systems like:
- **Quantum scattering problems**, where particles are not bound and their energies can vary continuously.
- **Quantum fields** in free space, where particles like photons can exhibit any energy and momentum.

In any quantum system, whether the energy eigenbasis is infinite and whether the energy spectrum is continuous can provide deep insights into the nature of the system, its stability, and its interactions. The study of these characteristics helps in understanding fundamental processes in quantum mechanics, such as tunneling, bonding in molecules, and the propagation of waves in various media.

## Degeneracy

Prompt: Is it fair to say that degeneracy is unique to Hamiltonian and not positional or momentum observables?

It is generally accurate to say that degeneracy is more commonly and prominently discussed in relation to the Hamiltonian (energy operator) in quantum mechanics than for position or momentum observables. This distinction arises primarily due to the nature of the physical quantities these operators represent and the types of quantum systems commonly studied. Here's a breakdown to clarify this concept:

### 1. **Degeneracy of the Hamiltonian:**
- The Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy of a quantum system, often exhibits degeneracy, especially in systems with specific symmetries. For example, in atomic and molecular physics, certain energy levels can have multiple independent eigenstates corresponding to the same energy due to spherical or other symmetries. This degeneracy is fundamental in explaining many physical phenomena, including the fine structure of spectral lines and various selection rules in quantum mechanics.

### 2. **Degeneracy of Position and Momentum Observables:**
- **Position and Momentum Operators:** These are fundamental observables in quantum mechanics but typically do not exhibit degeneracy in the same way the Hamiltonian does. The main reason is that the eigenstates of position and momentum are inherently different in nature:
  - **Position Eigenstates:** An eigenstate of the position operator corresponds to a state where the particle's position is precisely defined. These states are represented by delta functions in position space and are not degenerate because each position eigenstate corresponds uniquely to one position value.
  - **Momentum Eigenstates:** Similar to position, momentum eigenstates, represented by plane waves in position space, correspond uniquely to specific momentum values. Thus, each momentum eigenstate is distinct for different momentum values and typically does not exhibit degeneracy.

### 3. **Exceptions and Considerations:**
- In quantum systems where position or momentum are coupled to other degrees of freedom or influenced by external fields, it's theoretically possible to find degeneracies related to these observables, but this is less common and usually requires specific and unusual conditions or symmetries.
- Additionally, in periodic systems or systems with boundary conditions (like particles in a crystal lattice), momentum can have degenerate states due to the symmetry of the system. However, these are generally considered special cases and are often studied in the context of solid-state physics.

### Summary:
In conclusion, while it's not strictly correct to say that degeneracy cannot occur for position or momentum observables, it is fair to state that degeneracy is primarily associated with and more relevant to the Hamiltonian in most quantum mechanical systems. This association is due to the nature of energy as a conserved and more 'global' property of systems, often affected by symmetries that do not similarly impact position or momentum directly.
